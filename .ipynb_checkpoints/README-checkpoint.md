# Análisis y Predicción del Riesgo de Siniestro en Seguros de Automóviles

The insurance sector faces ongoing challenges in accurately assessing claim risk, a key factor that directly impacts profitability, premium allocation, and capital management. Increasing regulatory pressure—through frameworks such as Solvency II—imposes strict requirements regarding solvency, risk governance, and financial transparency, demanding the use of robust and auditable models for insurance risk estimation. 

Advances in machine learning techniques and statistical modeling have significantly improved claim prediction by leveraging the availability of historical insurance data. In this study, we use the Porto Seguro Safe Driver Prediction dataset to develop predictive models aimed at optimizing claim risk estimation, thereby enhancing pricing accuracy and capital allocation. 

However, the problem exhibits a structurally imbalanced class distribution, as most policyholders do not file claims. This introduces methodological challenges in detecting low-frequency events with high reliability. Beyond predictive performance, the proposed approach emphasizes explainability, robustness, and regulatory compliance, aligning with Solvency II requirements and EIOPA guidelines on the use of AI in insurance. An MLOps perspective is also incorporated, ensuring traceability, monitoring, and efficient model deployment in production environments. 

The combination of advanced modeling, regulatory governance, and operational scalability positions this proposal at the intersection of predictive accuracy, interpretability, and regulatory compliance within the insurance domain.
